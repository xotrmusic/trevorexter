"(link: https://playitlikeitsmusic.com text: Play It Like It's Music)" is a place where professional musicians talk shop and craft. Since I have yet to find the show I really want to hear, this is my own attempt at making one.

*The show ran for 80 episodes and is currently on a hiatus while I work on some new music projects. 
All episodes are available online.*

I speak to a rich variety of working musicians from every genre. If you love to play, yearn to play or just want to experience what a musical life feels like from the inside, then this is the show for you. 

We're all contending with a mutating professional landscape, jacked revenue streams and a lot of noise out here in the culture, but you gotta keep playing.
