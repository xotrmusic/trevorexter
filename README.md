### "The acid-banjo god of the cello"

*Steven Bernstein (The Hot 9, Lounge Lizards, Levon Helm Band, Sex Mob)*

### “Singer and unconventional cellist Trevor Exter plucks and whacks at his big instrument and guides it through multiple climaxes.”

*Time Out New York*

### “If you’re expecting a sedate orchestra recital, you’d better think again…. Exter’s crooning voice harkens back to an era of music where men weren’t afraid to wear their hearts on their sleeves.”

*Chris Kocher, Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin*

### “…makes you feel like you found something you didn’t even know you were missing… Trevor Exter nails it.”

*Ethan Kanat, BreakThruRadio.com*

For most of his life, Trevor Exter has been a professional singer and cellist with his own approach to all aspects of composing, songwriting, producing, performing and touring. He’s had a few bands where he got to make a spectacle of himself, and some producers like to use him as a secret weapon.

First-time listeners are sometimes puzzled when Exter steps on stage, a cello plugged into an amp the way a rocker bears his axe. Exter has toured with De La Guarda, Steve Kimock, author James McBride, DJ Tasha Blank and his duo with John Kimock, XVSK. He frequently performs solo.
